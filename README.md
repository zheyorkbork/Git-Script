# Git Script 

A git script that does all the git work for you!
I made this for other people who don't know or think that typing all the git commands is a waste of time.

# README 

THERE iS AN INSTRUCTIONS.txt FILE IN THIS REPO
THIS IS ONLY COMPATIBLE WITH LINUX AND MACOS!!!, IT ALSO WORKS ON WINDOWS F YOU HAVE SHELL, NOT POWERSHELL!

# README2 

This script only works if you already add a remote location, if you haven't made or linked your git with github, THIS WON'T WORK.

- If you read this, thank you this will be in the other README files.
