To run the script simply run
"./git-script.sh"
in the terminal


Q: Why isn't this working?

A1: if
"./git-script.sh"
doesn't work than try: sudo chmod +x git-script.sh
and try running it again.

A2: This script only works in an existing repository, if you're making a new repository this won't work.
